# Medichain Mobile App Prototype


## Getting Started

MediChain is a mobile-app designed to suit the needs of modern hospitals and their patient record system by securely handling the storage and migration of records within/between hospitals using blockchain technology, which in general, is an immutable transaction record that is maintained within a distributed network of peer nodes. These nodes keep a copy of the ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a consensus process and are organized into blocks with a hash that links each block to the one before it. Made by Kamal Kumar Khatri and Hardeep Singh.
